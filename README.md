### About me

Iâ€™m Kelly Castro ðŸ‘‹, a Data Engineer & DevOps enthusiast who loves turning complex data into clear, strategic insights. Over the past decade, I've designed and built cloud-native platforms on Microsoft Azure, always with an eye on delivering real business value.

At SLB OneSubsea, I modernized our ISO 50001 compliance process by automating energy-data ingestion and reporting. Using Event Hubs â†’ ADLS Gen2 â†’ Azure Databricks and Data Factory, I replaced weeks of manual work with real-time Power BI dashboards, cutting audit prep from days to hours.

I also led ARBOSOCIAL: an open-source arbovirus prediction system (https://github.com/data-lab-org/ARBOSOCIAL). By integrating social, climate and health data, building ensemble ML models in PySpark and scikit-learn, and surfacing results in interactive notebooks, we achieved over 85% accuracy and supported early-warning efforts in pilot regions.

Most recently, I delivered a Quality Notifications platform in SLB OneSubsea, that slashed our SLA from 20 to 7 days and boosted operational efficiency by 15%. Streaming SAP alerts into Event Hubs, processing them with Databricks, and visualizing in Power BI (all provisioned via Terraform and CI/CD pipelines), our team now focuses on solving root causes instead of wrangling spreadsheets.

I thrive in Agile squads, collaborating with engineers, simulation experts and product teams. Iâ€™m fluent in Python, SQL, DAX and CI/CD tools (Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions), and Iâ€™m sharpening my Kubernetes skills in preparation for CKAD.
