### About me

"I leverage data as strategic assets for smart decisions."

As a Software Engineer specialized in Big Data and Data Engineering (Poli-USP) with an MBA in Data Science (ICMC-USP), I bring over 10 years of experience leading innovative technology projects. Currently working in Continuous Improvement and Digital Transformation, I build high-performance databases, data models, pipelines, and complex ETL processes, using advanced analytics and predictive modeling to deliver measurable business resultsâ€”such as a 15% increase in operational efficiency (resolution of non-compliance notifications) and achieving ISO 50001 certification in energy efficiency.

My expertise includes Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy), SQL, JavaScript, AWS (EC2, Lightsail, SageMaker), Azure (Data Factory, Databricks, Fabric), Power BI, SAP S/4HANA, and Agile methodologies.

Committed to promoting Free Software and digital innovation, my goal is always to develop solutions that minimize waste, enhance collective performance, and foster continuous learning.
