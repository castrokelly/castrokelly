### I ask data the right questions to turn raw numbers into strategic decisions.

I work seamlessly across descriptive and inferential analysis, statistical modeling, Business Intelligence and data product development. My solid background in software engineering informs my CI/CD practices and enables me to contribute smoothly to Agile teams.

My expertise encompasses time-series analysis, classical machine learning, deep learning and large language models (LLMs), as well as complex interactive visualizations built with React and d3.js. For more than 3 years Iâ€™ve worked with Microsoftâ€¯Azure cloud services (including ADF, Databricks, Azureâ€¯ML and Powerâ€¯BI) while specializing in SQL query optimization and advanced Python programming using frameworks such as Flask, FastAPI, scikitâ€‘learn, PyTorch and Streamlit.

Since 2015 I have been immersed in the openâ€‘source and startup ecosystems, collaborating with highâ€‘performing, crossâ€‘functional teams. Over the past 3 years I have contributed to data teams in complex industrial settings, focusing on anomalyâ€‘detection systems, recommendation engines and computerâ€‘vision projects: boosting operational efficiency, advancing Industryâ€¯4.0 initiatives and delivering measurable profits.

I also led ARBOSOCIAL: an open-source arbovirus prediction system [data-lab-org/ARBOSOCIAL](https://github.com/data-lab-org/ARBOSOCIAL). By integrating social, climate and health data, building ensemble ML models in PySpark and scikit-learn, and surfacing results in interactive notebooks, we achieved over 85% accuracy and supported early-warning efforts in pilot regions.

Most recently, I delivered a Quality Notifications platform in SLB OneSubsea, that slashed our SLA from 20 to 7 days and boosted operational efficiency by 15%. Streaming SAP alerts into Event Hubs, processing them with Databricks, and visualizing in Power BI (all provisioned via Terraform and CI/CD pipelines), our team now focuses on solving root causes instead of wrangling spreadsheets.

I thrive in Agile squads, collaborating with engineers, simulation experts and product teams. Iâ€™m fluent in Python, SQL, DAX and CI/CD tools (Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions), and Iâ€™m sharpening my Kubernetes skills in preparation for CKAD.
